The traveling salesman problem has been the main focus of computer science researchers, economists and businessmen. If optimally implemented, the traveling salesman problem can result in decreased travel time and decreased loop times. This will allow the public to enjoy more time on vacation instead of using that time traveling and will allow businesses to minimize costs of daily routes traveled throughout the world. In our implementation of this famous algorithm we mimicked the routing of ants to determine where the optimal route will be.
