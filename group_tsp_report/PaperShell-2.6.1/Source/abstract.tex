The NP-complete traveling salesperson problem (TSP) has been studied for decades by the
computer science community. It's combinatorial search space makes it difficult to
solve in a reasonable amount of time for any problem with more than a few cities.
Due to its simple nature, however, it has become a common benchmark and testing ground
for many new algorithms and optimization techniques, including the several variations
of the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. For our final project, we implemented a 
simple version of the Max-Min Ant System algorithm, discuss its computational 
complexity, and analyze its performance empirically. We find that while our 
implementation could be improved in many ways and is dependent on the choice
of hyperparameters, it can nevertheless outperform both greedy and branch-and-Bound
algorithms on the asymmetric TSP.

% The traveling salesman problem has been the main focus of computer science researchers, economists and businessmen. If optimally implemented, the traveling salesman problem can result in decreased travel time and decreased loop times. This will allow the public to enjoy more time on vacation instead of using that time traveling and will allow businesses to minimize costs of daily routes traveled throughout the world. In our implementation of this famous algorithm we mimicked the routing of ants to determine where the optimal route will be.
